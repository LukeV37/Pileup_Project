To run a pythia simulation use the following command with the root or hepmc output file format option:
```
./run.sh {root|hepmc}
```

To edit the number of events or other parameters of the simluation, modify the code in the `src` folder accordingly. 

Many of the pythia settings can be directly configured in the `cmnd` file.
